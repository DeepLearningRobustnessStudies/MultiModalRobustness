# Text Perturbations
To genearate text perturbations, code is available in `generate_noisy_text.py`. 
You can call this script from the command line, for example:

```bash
python generate_noisy_text.py msrvtt --meta_pth msvrtt_eval.csv --text_style --textflint
```
This will call perturbations to run for those generated by the TextStyle and TextFlint packages for the 
MSRVTT dataset using the csv file that has (at minimum) columns for video_id and text. 

This is the same procedure for the MC VideoQA on MSRVTT in `generate_noisy_mc_videoqa.py`

# Video Perturbations
We provide both the on-the-fly generation of perturbations in `video_perturbations.py` which is useful for processing 
pre-extracted features and generating noisy video copies in `generate_noisy_videos.py`.

To run `generate_noisy_videos.py`, an example is:

```bash
python generate_noisy_videos.py msrvtt data/msrvtt/videos data/msrvtt/noisy_videos blur
```
This will run generating videos for MSRVTT where the original videos are stored in `data/msrvtt/videos`, perturbing with
blur and saving the copies in `data/msrvtt/noisy_videos`.

Use `video_perturbations.py` by creating a `VideoPerturbation` object by initializing the perturbation and severity.
This is useful when modifying video feature extractor code from 
[fairseq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/MMPT/scripts/video_feature_extractor)
and [VideoFeatureExtractor](https://github.com/ArrowLuo/VideoFeatureExtractor/).
